  {
    question: "How much does a wedding coffee bar, dessert cart, or rental plan cost?",
    answer:
      "Wedding pricing is prepared by quote and depends on the selected experiences, guest count, service duration, menu, customization, rental quantities, venue logistics, and travel. Couples can share their date, venue, estimated guest count, and preferred services to receive a proposal shaped around the wedding.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should coffee be served at a wedding?",
    answer:
      "Coffee can be served before the ceremony, during guest arrival or cocktail hour, with dessert, during the reception, or as a late-night moment. The best window depends on when guests will welcome a beverage, how coffee fits the food and bar plan, and whether the venue can support setup and service without interrupting another transition.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a coffee bar appropriate for cocktail hour?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when it supports the transition between ceremony and reception. A coffee bar can give guests a staffed hospitality point with hot, iced, matcha, and non-coffee choices while they gather. Placement, menu breadth, service duration, guest count, and coordination with the venue, planner, caterer, and beverage program determine whether cocktail hour is the right window.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can coffee and dessert be booked together?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can seating and rentals be included?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Chairs, tables, cocktail tables, tents, linens, and lighting can be planned alongside Coffee Bar or Sweet Cart. Inventory, quantities, delivery, setup, teardown, access, and fees must be confirmed for the venue and date.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can wedding menus, cups, and signage be customized?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Signature beverages, seasonal selections, menu displays, custom cups, event signage, cart branding, dessert presentation, and other visual details can be discussed. Final possibilities depend on the approved direction, timeline, and production requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How early should couples book?",
    answer:
      "Luxe recommends booking early for weddings and peak-season dates, especially from April through October. No universal lead time is promised because availability depends on the date, requested experiences, staffing, travel, and logistics.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Luxe coordinate with wedding planners and venues?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Luxe can coordinate timing, access, placement, setup, service flow, and event-day requirements with couples, planners, coordinators, venues, and relevant vendors. Exact responsibilities are confirmed during planning.",
